# AI Fundation
This repo contains my notes and implementations of basic machine learning algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, Neural Networks etc.).  
## Codes
Almost all codes are implemented with python, numpy and pandas. There may be more than one implementation version of an algorithm. 
## Notes And Summaries
Each fold contains a `README` file, which explains the principle of the algorithm in detail. Since Tex formula in github markdown does not look well, I use png instead (except KNN README file).  
If you have a better way to display a formula in github markdown, please tell me by opening an issue. :smile: 
## Requirement
- python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (not necessary)
